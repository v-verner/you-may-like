A simple plugin that recommends content based on previous user views.

== Description ==

"You May Like" is a plugin that generates personalized post reading recommendations for website visitors. Recommendations are made based on the tags you enter in your posts and how many times each tag is read by the visitor in question.

As the visitor reads more content on your site, the more relevant the recommendations will be, so it is essential that the tags are correctly placed in the posts.

**IMPORTANT!** This plugin uses cookies to recommend content, so it is important for your site to request the use of cookies to your visitors.

Note: The Plugin is in the testing phase and should be used with caution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

The plugin saves a cookie on the site visitor's computer and as the user navigates through blog posts, it generates a "read rank" of the user. Similar to the posts feed algorithm used by Facebook.
