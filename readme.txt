A personalized content recommendation system for every reader of your blog. Simple but powerful.

== Description ==

You May Like, a.k.a. YML, brings new content recommendation possibilities to your blog readers.

Instead of simple recommendations based on the categories and tags of the post, this plugin makes content recommendations based on previous readings and visitors' visits to your blog.

The more the visitor reads content, the smarter the algorithm gets and the better the content recommendation!

For the proper functioning of the recommendation algorithm, it is essential to use tags in the posts.

IMPORTANT! This plugin uses cookies to manage each visitor's previous readings. Be sure to request consent to use cookies to comply with data protection laws.

Note: This plugin is in the testing phase and should be used with caution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

The plugin saves a cookie on the site visitor's computer and as the user navigates through blog posts, it generates a "read rank" of the user. Similar to the posts feed algorithm used by Facebook.

Read the plugin documentation and walkthrough. Make sure the settings have been made and the shortcode "[you_may_like]" has been inserted into the pages.
